I've spent the last 10 years contributing to a wide variety of web projects while working to diversify my skillset along the way.  I've had the opportunity to work with some great people on some great projects that have spanned through the entire web development life cycle. From planning, strategy, and design to development, testing, and maintenance I've gained useful experience that I have continued to apply to various positions throughout my career.

I am the current lead web developer for a local non profit which has allowed me to utilize my skills and experience to contribute in many ways beyond web development such as: project management, graphic design, web marketing, SEO, and content strategy.

I'm always looking for ways to grow and better myself. I enjoy learning new skills and I welcome the opportunity challenge to dive into a new project and contribute where needed.
