I've spent the last 10 years contributing to a wide variety of web projects that have spanned through the entire web development life cycle.  From planning, strategy, and design to development, testing, and maintenance I've gained useful experience that I have continued to apply to various positions throughout my career.  

I am the current lead web developer for a local non profit which has allowed me to utilize my diverse set of skills and experience to contribute in many ways beyond web development such as: project management, graphic design, web marketing, SEO, and content strategy.

I enjoy the process of learning new technologies and the creative challenge of incorporating them into projects. I always welcome the opportunity to connect with others looking for digital growth in order to build a better web.
