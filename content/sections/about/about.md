I've spent the last 10 years working on a wide variety of web project contributing where needed.  From building a fully scalable ecommerce site from the ground up to developing content strategies and implementing SEO enhancements.

I am the current lead web developer for a local non profit which has allowed me to utilize my skills and experience to contribute in many ways beyond web development such as: project management, graphic design, web marketing, SEO, and content strategy.

I'm always looking for ways to grow and better myself. I enjoy learning new skills and I welcome the opportunity challenge to dive into a new project and contribute where needed.
