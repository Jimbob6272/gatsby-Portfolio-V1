This was a passion project of mine to test my PhotoShop skills by combining me with my wife's favorite band. A lot of time went into setting up lighting and photographing my head in the correct positions.  I then used Adobe PhotoShop  tools to match skin tones, remove faces (sounds weird to say), and properly layer my face onto their heads (again, sounds weird).
