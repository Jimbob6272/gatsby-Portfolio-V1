This was broken WordPress site that I was asked to bring back to life focusing on these key requests: fix general functionality, better highlight CTA's and incorporate youtube videos (as well as a few other things). 
</br></br>

I was provided a limited admin to make this happen, so removing or installing certain themes and plugins was not an option. I corrected many issues by deactivating  the existing custom theme (was no longer being updated) and updating existing plugins. I then worked with the owner to customize a default theme and build out some of the main pages to incorporate new content and format it in a clean and readable way.  I created custom reusable page blocks and provided training guides on how to go about updating content.
