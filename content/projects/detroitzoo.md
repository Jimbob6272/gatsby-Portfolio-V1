This is the main site for The Detroit Zoo and it's the hub for 10+ sub-sites I manage on a daily basis through WP-Engine. I routinely develop pages and manage content meeting with multiple departments to maintain up-to-date information. The bulk of my time is taking raw content, formatting it in an engaging way that is on brand, and ensuring pages are responsive and WCAG friendly.
