The goal of this project was to improve user experience and  better highlight calls to action for the site. I accomplished this by adding a clear structure to the text, developing a typographic hierarchy and better highlighting CTAs. I then incorporated graphics throughout the site adding interest and clearly defined sections. I also created responsive CSS classes for our purchasing cards to ensure consistency across all devices and browsers.
