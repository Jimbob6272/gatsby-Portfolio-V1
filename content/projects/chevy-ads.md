These are 3 graphics I was asked to create for website and ad service use. I was given the desired resolutions and and asset folder containing images, logo, and the information they wanted emphasized. I then successfully create visually cohesive series of graphics in Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator by utilizing personally created brushes, clean typography, clear layout, and color matching.
